## Overview

Gender Classification on Twitter data is essential for understanding audience demographics, sentiment analysis, and targeted marketing. This project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to classify users' gender based on their tweets and profile data.

## Dataset

Source: Twitter data was collected, including profile information, tweets, and metadata for each user.

Features: Includes text data (tweets), user profile attributes (e.g., description, follower count).

Preprocessing: Text data was cleaned and tokenized. Features were engineered from the text, including word embeddings and sentiment scores.
## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps include:

Text Cleaning: Removing special characters, URLs, and stop words.

Tokenization: Converting text into tokens for analysis.

Feature Engineering: Generating features like sentiment, word embeddings, and character count.
Modeling

Several machine learning models were tested to optimize accuracy, including:

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Random Forest

Model Selection

After hyperparameter tuning, Logistic Regression and SVM provided the best results for classification accuracy.

## Technologies Used

Python: For data processing and modeling.

NLTK & Scikit-Learn: For natural language processing and machine learning.

Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib: For data visualization.
## Results

Accuracy: Achieved an accuracy of approximately 85% using SVM for gender classification.

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were calculated to evaluate model performance.
